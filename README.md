# NLW3_Happy

Website made from scratch during the Next Level Week #3, an event from the brazillian startup Rocketseat that takes a beginner through the building of a project from absolute 0
to the complete thing.

The event is divided into tracks (Discovery and Omnistack), I for one chose the discovery track.

In this edition the project was an platform for booking times to visit kids in orphanages.

It was taught and developed many technologies, such as, Node.js, Javascript, CSS3, HTML5.
